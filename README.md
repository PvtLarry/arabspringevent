# arabspringevent

# My event chain for the Arab Spring revolutions. Fascist, Nationalist and Reactionary governments have a chance of getting this event between 2010 and 2015, with the chances of it firing increasing if a neighboring country is undergoing revolution. If the player attempts to resist then things will get increasingly difficult as debuff national ideas begin to stack, creating ideological drift and reducing national unity and industrial output. Unless the protests are successfully suppressed by force (small chance) then the event chain will end either with a negotiated settlement and elections, a military coup, or a civil war.

# I intend to add country-specific events which add the correct political parties and leaders to countries that have the idea_arab_spring idea.
